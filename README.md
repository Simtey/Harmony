# Animation tools for Toon Boom Harmony #

**ST_ToggleFrameMarkers** : Add / delete a frame marker on the selected frame. 
* Change the color by clicking again on it (Red, Blue, Orange, none)
* More efficient when configured as a shortcut.

**ST_TobAntkSwitch** : Switch between three way to show the animatic.
* mode 1 = the original display (animatic in small on the scene)
* mode 2 = animatic full screen over the scene
* mode 3 = new Display_Animatic to go on another camera
